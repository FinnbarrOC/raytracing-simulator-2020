## Raytracing Simulator 2020

###### Lukas Finnbarr O'Callahan - CSC 418, LEC 0101

This is a simple interactive Unity demo that visualizes the raycasting process in action.
Controls are explained in the top-left corner of the screen.
All scripts were written by me, and models were obtained for free from [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/).

For all source code and a playable Windows build, see the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/FinnbarrOC/raytracing-simulator-2020) for this project.
